# Sets

# Given two sentences, you need to find and output the number of the common words (words that are present in both sentences).

# Sample Input:
# this is some text
# I would like this tea and some cookies

# Sample Output:
# 2

# The words 'some' and 'this' appear in both sentences.
# Hint - You can use the split() function to get a list of words in a string and then use the set() function to convert it into a set. For example, to convert the list x to a set you can use: set(x)
  
s1 = input() 
s2 = input() 

list1 = s1.split()
list2 = s2.split()

print(len(set(list1)&set(list2)))
